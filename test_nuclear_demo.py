    Sigmund Loland, in his article 'Performance-Enhancing Drugs, Sport, and the Ideal of Natural Athletic Performance,' 
    critically examines the common reasons for prohibiting PEDs. He argues that the typical fairness and health-related 
    arguments aren't sufficient on their own. Instead, Loland proposes that we need to consider the ideal of natural 
    athletic performance. Cohen and Elliot provide empirical evidence demonstrating significant health risks associated 
    with prolonged PED use, including cardiovascular complications and endocrine disruption.
