# Chunking & Preprocessing Removal - System Update

## Summary
Removed all chunking and preprocessing logic to fix memory issues and the copy-paste bug where text wasn't being humanized.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Copy-Paste Bug** ✅
**Issue**: Text was being returned unchanged instead of humanized
**Root Cause**: 
- Claude model name was outdated (`claude-3-sonnet-20240229`) causing 404 errors
- Silent fallback in `claude_engine.py` returned original text on errors
- Users received their input text back without any transformation

**Solution**:
- Updated Claude model to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- Removed silent fallback - now raises proper errors instead of hiding failures
- Errors propagate correctly to trigger fallback engines

### 2. **Memory Issues / Worker Timeouts** ✅
**Issue**: Worker processes killed with SIGKILL, "Perhaps out of memory?" errors
**Root Cause**: 
- Chunking system created multiple text chunks with overlaps
- Each chunk required separate LLM API calls
- Memory accumulated during chunk processing and rejoining
- Total processing time exceeded Gunicorn worker timeout (30s default)

**Solution**:
- Completely removed chunking logic (`TextChunker`, `TextRejoiner`)
- Direct single API call per humanization request
- Reduced memory footprint significantly
- Faster processing time (single API call vs multiple)

### 3. **DeepSeek Timeout Errors** ✅
**Issue**: DeepSeek requests timing out causing 500 errors
**Root Cause**: Long processing times from chunking + DeepSeek's slower response

**Solution**:
- Single API call eliminates cumulative timeout issues
- Fallback to Claude if selected engine fails
- Better error messages returned to users

## Changes Made

### `humanizer/utils.py`
**Before**: 127 lines with chunking logic
**After**: 70 lines - direct engine calls only

```python
# OLD (chunking):
def humanize_text_with_engine(text: str, engine: str) -> str:
    return humanize_with_chunking(text, engine)

# NEW (direct):
def humanize_text_with_engine(text: str, engine: str) -> str:
    handler = ENGINE_HANDLERS[engine]
    return handler(text)  # Single call, no chunks
```

**Removed**:
- `humanize_with_chunking()` function
- `TextChunker` import and usage
- `TextRejoiner` import and usage
- Chunk processing loops
- Memory management (gc.collect())
- Chunk timing logic

**Added**:
- Increased max character limit to 10,000 (from 8,000)
- Simplified error handling

### `humanizer/views.py`
**Before**: 3-stage pipeline (Preprocess → Humanize → Validate → Post-process)
**After**: Simplified pipeline (Humanize → Optional Post-process)

**Removed**:
- `TextPreprocessor` import and usage
- `HumanizationValidator` import and usage
- Stage 1: Preprocessing step
- Stage 3: Validation step
- Validation data in JSON response

**Kept**:
- Stage 2: Direct LLM humanization
- Optional: Post-processing for natural imperfections
- Error handling with Claude fallback
- Word balance tracking
- Readability scores

### `humanizer/engine_config.py`
**Changed**:
- Claude model: `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`

### `humanizer/llm_engines/claude_engine.py`
**Changed**:
```python
# OLD (silent fallback):
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    humanized_chunks.append(chunk)  # Return original text

# NEW (proper error):
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    raise RuntimeError(f"Claude API failed: {e}") from e
```

## How It Works Now

### Simplified Flow:
1. User submits text via `/humanizer/humanize/`
2. **Validation**: Check word balance, engine selection
3. **Humanization**: Single API call to selected engine (DeepSeek/Claude/OpenAI)
4. **Fallback**: If engine fails, automatically retry with Claude
5. **Post-processing** (optional): Add natural imperfections
6. **Response**: Return humanized text with scores

### Engine Functions:
```python
# All engines now accept text directly (no chunk_index):
humanize_with_claude(text: str) -> str
humanize_with_openai(text: str) -> str  
humanize_with_deepseek(text: str) -> str
```

### Error Handling:
- Engines raise `RuntimeError` on API failures
- View catches errors and tries Claude fallback
- If Claude also fails, returns 503 error to user
- No more silent failures or original text returns

## Benefits

✅ **Faster**: Single API call instead of multiple chunks
✅ **Lower Memory**: No chunk storage, overlap management, or rejoining
✅ **Clearer Errors**: Proper error propagation instead of silent fallbacks
✅ **Actually Humanizes**: Text is transformed instead of copy-pasted
✅ **Simpler Code**: 70 lines instead of 127 in utils.py
✅ **Better UX**: Users see real errors instead of getting their input back

## Limitations

⚠️ **Text Length**: Max 10,000 characters per request (API limits)
- Users with longer texts need to split manually
- Consider adding client-side warning at ~9,000 chars

⚠️ **No Validation**: Removed preservation checks for citations/URLs
- LLM prompts must handle this (currently configured to preserve)
- Could re-add lightweight validation if needed

⚠️ **Single Pass**: No multi-chunk consistency checks
- For 10k chars or less, single LLM call is sufficient
- LLMs handle context better in one pass anyway

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Claude engine with updated model name
- [ ] DeepSeek engine (test in production)
- [ ] OpenAI engine (test in production)
- [ ] Text under 1,000 chars
- [ ] Text 5,000-10,000 chars
- [ ] Error handling with invalid API key
- [ ] Fallback to Claude when DeepSeek fails
- [ ] Post-processing adds variations
- [ ] Word balance updates correctly

## Deployment

Changes pushed to GitHub: **commit b51010f**

Render will auto-deploy. Watch logs for:
- ✅ No more "Processing X chunks..." messages
- ✅ "Processing with {engine} engine (no chunking)..." instead
- ✅ Faster response times (10-20s instead of 30s+)
- ✅ No worker timeout errors
- ✅ Humanized output instead of copy-pasted input

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert to commit `36bec29`:
```bash
git revert b51010f
git push origin main
```

This will restore chunking system (but keep outdated Claude model).

Better rollback: Cherry-pick just the Claude model update:
```bash
git checkout 36bec29
# Manually update claude model in engine_config.py
git add humanizer/engine_config.py
git commit -m "Update Claude model only"
git push origin main
```
