# ‚úÖ TOAST NOTIFICATIONS & PROMPTS OVERHAUL

## Summary

Two major improvements implemented:
1. ‚úÖ **Toast notifications made smaller** - Compact, less intrusive design
2. ‚úÖ **All 3 prompts completely rewritten** - Maximum error injection + extreme perplexity + formal-but-flawed tone

---

## 1. TOAST NOTIFICATIONS - COMPACT DESIGN

### Changes Made:

**BEFORE:**
```css
.messages {
    max-width: 400px;
    top: var(--spacing-lg);      /* 2rem */
    right: var(--spacing-lg);    /* 2rem */
}

.message {
    padding: var(--spacing-md);   /* 1.5rem */
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);
    border-left: 4px solid;
    border-radius: var(--radius-md);
}
```

**AFTER:**
```css
.messages {
    max-width: 280px;            /* 30% smaller */
    top: var(--spacing-sm);      /* 1rem - closer to top */
    right: var(--spacing-sm);    /* 1rem - closer to edge */
}

.message {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;        /* 50% less padding */
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;       /* Tighter spacing */
    border-left: 3px solid;      /* Thinner border */
    border-radius: 8px;          /* Smaller radius */
    font-size: 0.85rem;          /* Smaller text */
    line-height: 1.4;            /* Tighter line height */
}
```

### Visual Impact:

**BEFORE:**
```

‚îÇ                                      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    ‚úÖ Text humanized successfully    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                      ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
         (400px wide, chunky)
```

**AFTER:**
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  ‚úÖ Text humanized      ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
    (280px wide, compact)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ 30% smaller width (280px vs 400px)
- ‚úÖ 50% less padding (less visual bulk)
- ‚úÖ Positioned closer to corner (less screen space)
- ‚úÖ Smaller font (0.85rem - more compact)
- ‚úÖ Less intrusive, more professional
- ‚úÖ Still perfectly readable

## 2. PROMPTS COMPLETE REWRITE

### Core Philosophy Changes:

**OLD APPROACH:**
- Suggested errors as optional
- Generic vocabulary guidance
- Moderate formality
- Polite, AI-like tone

**NEW APPROACH:**
- **MANDATORY error injection (12-18% rate)**
- **EXTREME perplexity vocabulary**
- **Formal but deliberately flawed**
- **Commanding, direct tone**
- **Unpredictable word choices**

---

## 3. DEEPSEEK PROMPT - FULL REWRITE

### Key Changes:

#### Error Injection (EXPLICIT COMMANDS):
```python
## MANDATORY ERROR INJECTION (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

1. **GRAMMATICAL IMPERFECTIONS - FORCE 12-18% ERROR RATE:**
   - **COMMA SPLICES (MANDATORY):** Connect independent clauses with commas incorrectly, 
     this creates authentic human feel
   - **SENTENCE FRAGMENTS:** Use incomplete sentences occasionally. Like this one.
   - **RUN-ON SENTENCES:** Occasionally fuse two complete thoughts without proper 
     punctuation the reader can still follow but structure isn't perfect
   - **SUBJECT-VERB DISAGREEMENT (SUBTLE):** Occasional mismatches where the verb 
     don't quite align
   - **MISPLACED MODIFIERS:** Position descriptive phrases awkwardly but readably
   - **AWKWARD CONSTRUCTIONS:** "What the research demonstrates is that..." 
     instead of "The research shows..."
```

#### High Perplexity Vocabulary (EXPLICIT EXAMPLES):
```python
2. **EXTREMELY HIGH PERPLEXITY VOCABULARY COMMANDS:**
   - **USE UNPREDICTABLE SOPHISTICATED WORDS:** 
     Instead of "use" ‚Üí utilize, deploy, leverage, operationalize, instantiate
   - **INJECT UNEXPECTED FORMAL TERMS:** Replace common words with esoteric alternatives
   - **MIX REGISTER LEVELS:** Combine elevated academic language with slightly informal
   - **EMPLOY RARE BUT CORRECT SYNONYMS:** Choose the 5th or 6th synonym option
   - Examples: 
     * "elucidate" not "explain"
     * "cogitate" not "think"  
     * "paradigmatic" not "typical"
     * "instantiate" not "create"
```

#### Formal-But-Flawed Tone:
```python
4. **FORMAL BUT FLAWED TONE REQUIREMENTS:**
   - MAINTAIN SEMI-ACADEMIC REGISTER: Sound educated but not AI-perfect
   - OCCASIONAL COLLOQUIALISMS IN FORMAL CONTEXT: 
     "The methodology is, quite frankly, somewhat convoluted"
   - HEDGING LANGUAGE (OVERUSE): arguably, ostensibly, presumably, conceivably
   - POMPOUS BUT SLIGHTLY WRONG CONSTRUCTIONS: "One might postulate that..." 
     followed by informal phrasing
```

#### Critical Warnings:
```python
## CRITICAL REMINDERS:
‚ö†Ô∏è PERFECT GRAMMAR = AI DETECTION = FAILURE
‚ö†Ô∏è PREDICTABLE VOCABULARY = AI DETECTION = FAILURE  
‚ö†Ô∏è CONSISTENT SENTENCE STRUCTURE = AI DETECTION = FAILURE

YOU MUST INJECT ERRORS. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.
```

---

## 4. GEMINI PROMPT - FULL REWRITE

### Key Changes:

#### Mandatory Error Protocols:
```python
## MANDATORY IMPERFECTION PROTOCOLS:

1. **GRAMMATICAL ERROR INJECTION (15-20% ERROR RATE REQUIRED):**
   - **COMMA SPLICES:** Fuse independent clauses incorrectly, readers understand 
     but grammar checkers flag it
   - **FRAGMENTED CONSTRUCTIONS:** Incomplete sentences. Which actually emphasize 
     points effectively.
   - **INCONSISTENT TENSE:** Shift between past/present inappropriately
   - **PRONOUN-ANTECEDENT DISAGREEMENTS:** "Each researcher must submit their findings"
   - **DANGLING MODIFIERS:** "Having examined the data, the conclusion became apparent"
   - **AWKWARD PASSIVE VOICE OVERUSE:** "It can be seen that it has been demonstrated..."
```

#### Extreme Perplexity Deployment:
```python
2. **EXTREME PERPLEXITY VOCABULARY DEPLOYMENT:**
   - **UTILIZE SOPHISTICATED ALTERNATIVES:** 
     demonstrate ‚Üí evince, explicate, delineate, adumbrate
   - **INJECT UNEXPECTED LEXICAL CHOICES:** 
     problem ‚Üí conundrum, quandary, dilemma, predicament, exigency
   - **EMPLOY LATINATE CONSTRUCTIONS:** 
     use ‚Üí utilize ‚Üí operationalize ‚Üí instrumentalize
   - **EXAMPLES OF HIGH-PERPLEXITY SWAPS:**
     * show ‚Üí evince, manifest, substantiate, corroborate
     * important ‚Üí pivotal, salient, paramount, consequential
     * different ‚Üí disparate, divergent, heterogeneous, variegated
     * clear ‚Üí pellucid, perspicuous, unequivocal, manifest
```

#### Structural Chaos:
```python
3. **STRUCTURAL CHAOS (FORMAL BUT FLAWED):**
   - **EXTREME BURSTINESS:** Very short fragment. Followed by an extraordinarily 
     protracted sentence construction that meanders through multiple subordinate 
     clauses and parenthetical insertions while somehow maintaining a semblance 
     of coherence though perhaps straining the reader's cognitive capacity.
   - **BROKEN PARALLELISM:** "The study examines, is analyzing, and has demonstrated..."
   - **INTERRUPTING PHRASES:** Strategic placement‚Äîoften unnecessarily‚Äîof parenthetical 
     content that disrupts flow
```

#### Critical Warnings:
```python
## CRITICAL WARNINGS:
üö® GRAMMATICALLY PERFECT TEXT WILL BE DETECTED AS AI
üö® PREDICTABLE VOCABULARY PATTERNS TRIGGER DETECTION SYSTEMS
üö® CONSISTENT STRUCTURE INDICATES MACHINE GENERATION

INJECT ERRORS AND MAXIMIZE PERPLEXITY. THIS IS MANDATORY.
```

---

## 5. CHATGPT PROMPT - FULL REWRITE

### Key Changes:

#### Mandatory Error Injection:
```python
## MANDATORY ERROR INJECTION PROTOCOLS (12-18% ERROR RATE):

1. **GRAMMATICAL IMPERFECTIONS - DELIBERATELY INJECT:**
   - **COMMA SPLICES (REQUIRED):** Join complete sentences with commas, this technique 
     creates authentic human errors that readers parse naturally
   - **SENTENCE FRAGMENTS:** Deploy incomplete constructions. For rhythmic effect.
   - **RUN-ON SENTENCES:** Occasionally merge multiple independent clauses without 
     proper punctuation the meaning remains clear but the grammar isn't correct
   - **AGREEMENT ERRORS (SUBTLE):** Subject-verb mismatches where the verb don't 
     align perfectly
   - **FAULTY PARALLELISM:** "She is arguing, defends, and has been advocating..."
   - **UNCLEAR PRONOUN REFERENCES:** Use "it," "this," or "that" with ambiguous 
     antecedents
```

#### Extreme Perplexity Vocabulary:
```python
2. **EXTREME PERPLEXITY VOCABULARY INJECTION:**
   - **DEPLOY UNEXPECTED SOPHISTICATED ALTERNATIVES:** 
     * use ‚Üí utilize, deploy, leverage, operationalize, instrumentalize, instantiate
     * show ‚Üí demonstrate, evince, manifest, substantiate, exemplify, adumbrate
     * important ‚Üí salient, pivotal, paramount, consequential, germane, cardinal
     * problem ‚Üí conundrum, quandary, predicament, exigency, enigma
   - **EMPLOY RARE BUT ACCURATE SYNONYMS:** Choose 5th-7th most common alternatives
   - **INJECT LATINATE COMPLEXITY:** Prefer polysyllabic Romance-origin words
   - **EXAMPLES:** "elucidate" not "explain," "cogitate" not "think"
```

#### Formal-But-Flawed Engineering:
```python
4. **FORMAL-BUT-FLAWED TONE ENGINEERING:**
   - **MAINTAIN SEMI-ACADEMIC REGISTER:** Sound educated but not AI-perfect
   - **POMPOUS CONSTRUCTIONS:** "One might reasonably postulate that the 
     aforementioned phenomenon exhibits..."
   - **HEDGING LANGUAGE OVERUSE:** arguably, ostensibly, purportedly, conceivably, 
     presumably, potentially
   - **OCCASIONAL COLLOQUIALISM IN FORMAL CONTEXT:** "The methodology is, quite 
     frankly, rather convoluted"
   - **REDUNDANT QUALIFICATION:** "In order to adequately and sufficiently 
     demonstrate the salient points..."
```

#### Critical Imperatives:
```python
## CRITICAL IMPERATIVES:
‚ö†Ô∏è GRAMMATICALLY PERFECT TEXT = IMMEDIATE AI DETECTION
‚ö†Ô∏è PREDICTABLE VOCABULARY PATTERNS = DETECTION SYSTEM TRIGGER
‚ö†Ô∏è CONSISTENT SENTENCE STRUCTURE = MACHINE-GENERATED FLAG

ERROR INJECTION IS MANDATORY. PERPLEXITY MAXIMIZATION IS REQUIRED.
```

## 6. WHAT CHANGED ACROSS ALL 3 PROMPTS

### Error Injection:

**BEFORE:**
- "Introduce slightly awkward phrasing" (vague)
- "Create intentional fragment sentences" (optional-sounding)
- "Break perfect parallel structure" (no examples)

**AFTER:**
- "**COMMA SPLICES (MANDATORY):** Connect independent clauses with commas incorrectly, this creates authentic human feel" (explicit + example)
- "**SENTENCE FRAGMENTS:** Use incomplete sentences occasionally. Like this one." (demonstrated)
- "**RUN-ON SENTENCES:** Occasionally fuse two complete thoughts without proper punctuation the reader can still follow but structure isn't perfect" (shown in action)
- **12-18% error rate explicitly stated**

### Vocabulary/Perplexity:

**BEFORE:**
- "Use uncommon but appropriate vocabulary" (generic)
- "Create unexpected word combinations" (vague)
- "Mix formal and semi-formal" (no examples)

**AFTER:**
- "**USE UNPREDICTABLE SOPHISTICATED WORDS:** Instead of 'use' ‚Üí utilize, deploy, leverage, operationalize, instantiate" (concrete examples)
- "**EMPLOY RARE BUT ACCURATE SYNONYMS:** Choose 5th-7th most common alternatives, not obvious ones"
- "**HIGH-PERPLEXITY SWAPS:** show ‚Üí evince, manifest, substantiate, corroborate" (specific alternatives provided)
- "**MIX REGISTER LEVELS:** Combine elevated academic lexicon with slightly informal constructions" (clear direction)

### Tone:

**BEFORE:**
- "Maintain professional tone but add human character" (polite suggestion)
- "Create text that sounds like smart human thinking aloud" (indirect)

**AFTER:**
- "**FORMAL BUT FLAWED TONE REQUIREMENTS:** MAINTAIN SEMI-ACADEMIC REGISTER: Sound educated but not AI-perfect"
- "**POMPOUS BUT SLIGHTLY WRONG CONSTRUCTIONS:** 'One might postulate that...' followed by informal phrasing"
- "**OCCASIONAL COLLOQUIALISMS IN FORMAL CONTEXT:** 'The methodology is, quite frankly, somewhat convoluted'"
- **Formal bias explicitly stated with examples**

### Commands:

**BEFORE:**
- "Follow these commands" (polite)
- "Implement these techniques" (soft)
- "Create text that..." (suggestive)

**AFTER:**
- "**YOU MUST INJECT ERRORS. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.**" (absolute)
- "**ERROR INJECTION IS MANDATORY. PERPLEXITY MAXIMIZATION IS REQUIRED.**" (imperative)
- "**‚ö†Ô∏è PERFECT GRAMMAR = AI DETECTION = FAILURE**" (warning format)
- "**INJECT ERRORS AND MAXIMIZE PERPLEXITY. THIS IS MANDATORY.**" (commanding)

## 7. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF NEW VOCABULARY GUIDANCE

### High-Perplexity Word Lists NOW PROVIDED:

#### Replacements for Common Words:
```
use ‚Üí utilize, deploy, leverage, operationalize, instrumentalize, instantiate
show ‚Üí demonstrate, evince, manifest, substantiate, exemplify, adumbrate, corroborate
important ‚Üí salient, pivotal, paramount, consequential, germane, cardinal
problem ‚Üí conundrum, quandary, dilemma, predicament, exigency, enigma
different ‚Üí disparate, divergent, heterogeneous, variegated
clear ‚Üí pellucid, perspicuous, unequivocal, manifest
explain ‚Üí elucidate, explicate, delineate, adumbrate
think ‚Üí cogitate, ruminate, contemplate
typical ‚Üí paradigmatic, archetypal, exemplary
create ‚Üí instantiate, engender, generate
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Concrete examples** instead of vague instructions
- ‚úÖ **Multiple alternatives** for maximum unpredictability
- ‚úÖ **Sophisticated but correct** - all words are appropriate in formal contexts
- ‚úÖ **5th-7th synonym choices** - not the obvious first options AI would pick

---

## 8. ERROR TYPES NOW EXPLICITLY COMMANDED

## 10. EXPECTED OUTPUT CHANGES

### BEFORE (with old prompts):
```
The research demonstrates that artificial intelligence has significant implications 
for education. Studies show that students benefit from personalized learning 
approaches. This is important because traditional methods may not work for everyone.
```
**Issues:** Too polished, predictable vocabulary, perfect grammar

### AFTER (with new prompts):
```
The research evindicates‚Äîor perhaps more accurately delineates‚Äîthat artificial 
intelligence instantiates consequential ramifications for pedagogical contexts, 
this represents a paradigmatic shift. Empirical investigations corroborate the 
notion that learners derive substantive benefits from individualized instructional 
modalities. Which matters considerably. Given that conventional methodologies 
don't necessarily operationalize effectively for heterogeneous student populations.
```
**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ High perplexity: "evindicates," "delineates," "instantiates," "ramifications," "pedagogical"
- ‚úÖ Comma splice: "...contexts, this represents..."
- ‚úÖ Fragment: "Which matters considerably."
- ‚úÖ Agreement error: "methodologies don't" (should be "doesn't")
- ‚úÖ Formal but flawed tone maintained
- ‚úÖ Unpredictable word choices throughout
- ‚úÖ Still readable and comprehensible
