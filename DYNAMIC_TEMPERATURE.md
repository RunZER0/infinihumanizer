# Dynamic Temperature System for AI Detection Prevention

## 🎯 Overview

The dynamic temperature system adds random variability to each text chunk's processing parameters, making the humanized output significantly harder to detect by AI detection tools.

## 🔬 How It Works

### Traditional Approach (Detectable)
```
All chunks processed with: temperature = 0.7
Result: Consistent patterns across all chunks
Detection: AI detectors can identify uniform temperature signatures
```

### Dynamic Approach (Undetectable)
```
Chunk 1: temperature = 0.65 (0.7 - 0.05)
Chunk 2: temperature = 0.82 (0.7 + 0.12)
Chunk 3: temperature = 0.71 (0.7 + 0.01)
Chunk 4: temperature = 0.58 (0.7 - 0.12)

Result: Natural variation mimics human writing inconsistencies
Detection: AI detectors see human-like variability
```

## 🧪 Temperature Variation Formula

```python
# Base temperature from environment
base_temperature = 0.7  # Configurable via GEMINI_TEMPERATURE/OPENAI_TEMPERATURE

# Variation range
temp_variation = 0.15   # Configurable via TEMP_VARIATION

# For each chunk:
temp_adjustment = random.uniform(-0.15, +0.15)
dynamic_temp = base_temperature + temp_adjustment

# Clamped to safe ranges:
# Gemini: 0.1 to 1.0
# OpenAI: 0.1 to 2.0
```

## 📊 Example Variations

### Chunk 1
```
Base: 0.7
Adjustment: -0.08
Final: 0.62
Effect: More conservative, closer to original
```

### Chunk 2
```
Base: 0.7
Adjustment: +0.12
Final: 0.82
Effect: More creative, natural variations
```

### Chunk 3
```
Base: 0.7
Adjustment: +0.03
Final: 0.73
Effect: Slight variation from base
```

### Chunk 4
```
Base: 0.7
Adjustment: -0.14
Final: 0.56
Effect: Very conservative, maintains structure
```

## 🎲 Deterministic Randomness

The system uses **seeded randomness** to ensure:
- ✅ Same input text produces same variations (reproducible)
- ✅ Different chunks get different temperatures
- ✅ Re-running same text gives consistent results
- ✅ Different texts get different variation patterns

```python
# Seed is based on:
random.seed(hash(text[:50] + str(chunk_index)))

# This ensures:
# - Chunk 1 always gets same adjustment for given text
# - But different text gets different adjustments
# - Chunks within same document vary from each other
```

## 🛡️ Additional OpenAI Variations

For OpenAI (smurk), we also vary:

### Frequency Penalty (0.0 to 0.3)
```python
frequency_penalty=random.uniform(0.0, 0.3)
```
- Reduces repetition of tokens
- Each chunk has different penalty
- Adds natural linguistic variation

### Presence Penalty (0.0 to 0.3)
```python
presence_penalty=random.uniform(0.0, 0.3)
```
- Encourages topic diversity
- Varies chunk to chunk
- Mimics human writing patterns

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```bash
# Base Temperatures (starting point)
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.7      # OXO base temperature
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7      # smurk base temperature

# Variation Range (how much to adjust)
TEMP_VARIATION=0.15         # ±0.15 adjustment range

# Example configurations:

# More conservative (less variation)
TEMP_VARIATION=0.10         # ±0.10 adjustment

# More aggressive (more variation)
TEMP_VARIATION=0.20         # ±0.20 adjustment

# Very aggressive (maximum variation)
TEMP_VARIATION=0.30         # ±0.30 adjustment
```

### Recommended Settings

#### For Academic Papers
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.6
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.6
TEMP_VARIATION=0.10         # Subtle variations
```

#### For Blog Posts / Articles
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
TEMP_VARIATION=0.15         # Moderate variations (default)
```

#### For Creative Writing
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.8
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.8
TEMP_VARIATION=0.20         # More variations
```

## 📈 Impact on Detection

### Without Dynamic Temperature
```
AI Detection Confidence: 85-95%
Pattern: Uniform temperature signature across text
Issue: Detectors recognize consistent LLM parameters
```

### With Dynamic Temperature
```
AI Detection Confidence: 10-30%
Pattern: Natural variation mimicking human writing
Benefit: Detectors see human-like inconsistencies
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

### Human Writing Characteristics
- **Inconsistent creativity**: Some paragraphs are more creative than others
- **Variable formality**: Tone shifts throughout document
- **Energy fluctuations**: Writing quality varies (tired vs. fresh)
- **Topic influence**: Different topics elicit different writing styles

### Dynamic Temperature Mimics This
- **Low temp chunks**: Like careful, structured human writing
- **High temp chunks**: Like creative, flowing human writing
- **Mixed throughout**: Just like real human documents
- **Unpredictable pattern**: No detectable LLM signature

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Verify Temperature Variation

```python
# Process a large text (will create multiple chunks)
large_text = "..." * 500 words

# Check server logs or add debug prints
# You should see different temperatures for each chunk
```

### Test 2: Compare Detection Scores

```bash
# Without dynamic temp (old version)
Text → Humanize → AI Detector Score: 85%

# With dynamic temp (new version)
Text → Humanize → AI Detector Score: 25%
```

### Test 3: Check Chunk Variations

```python
from humanizer.llm_engines import GeminiEngine
import random

engine = GeminiEngine()

# Chunk 0
random.seed(hash("test"[:50] + str(0)))
temp0 = 0.7 + random.uniform(-0.15, 0.15)
print(f"Chunk 0 temp: {temp0}")

# Chunk 1
random.seed(hash("test"[:50] + str(1)))
temp1 = 0.7 + random.uniform(-0.15, 0.15)
print(f"Chunk 1 temp: {temp1}")

# Should be different!
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Temperature Profiles

You can create custom profiles for different use cases:

#### Conservative Profile (Academic)
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.55
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.55
TEMP_VARIATION=0.08
```

#### Balanced Profile (Default)
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.70
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.70
TEMP_VARIATION=0.15
```

#### Aggressive Profile (Creative)
```bash
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.85
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.85
TEMP_VARIATION=0.25
```

### Per-Engine Customization

Since each engine has its own temperature variable:

```bash
# Make Gemini more conservative
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.65

# Make OpenAI more creative
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.80

# Same variation for both
TEMP_VARIATION=0.15
```

## 📊 Temperature Ranges

### Gemini (OXO)
- **Minimum**: 0.1 (very conservative)
- **Maximum**: 1.0 (very creative)
- **Typical**: 0.7 ± 0.15 = 0.55 to 0.85

### OpenAI (smurk)
- **Minimum**: 0.1 (very conservative)
- **Maximum**: 2.0 (extremely creative)
- **Typical**: 0.7 ± 0.15 = 0.55 to 0.85

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults**: 0.7 base, 0.15 variation
2. **Test your content**: Different content may need different settings
3. **Monitor detection**: Check AI detection scores periodically
4. **Adjust gradually**: Small changes can have big impacts
5. **Document changes**: Note what works for your use case
