# Quick Start Guide - New Features

## 🎉 What's Fixed

This PR resolves two critical issues:

1. **Payment Bug Fixed** - No more exorbitant charges for KES users
2. **Admin Access Restored** - Easy superuser creation command

---

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### 1. Create Admin User (Do This First!)

```bash
# Use default credentials
python manage.py create_admin

# Or use custom credentials
python manage.py create_admin \
  --username myadmin \
  --email admin@mydomain.com \
  --password MySecurePassword123!
```

**Then access admin at:** `/admin/`

### 2. Test Payment Flow

The payment system now correctly handles both currencies:

- **African Users**: See prices in KES (1500, 3200, 6400)
- **International Users**: See prices in USD ($30, $75, $150)
- **All Users**: Pay the correct amount (no more 135× overcharge!)

---

## 📊 Payment Fix Details

### Before (WRONG ❌)
```
KES 1500 → Charged 202,500 KES
KES 3200 → Charged 432,000 KES
KES 6400 → Charged 864,000 KES
```

### After (CORRECT ✅)
```
KES 1500 → Charged 1,500 KES
KES 3200 → Charged 3,200 KES
KES 6400 → Charged 6,400 KES
```

### How It Works Now

1. **KES Users (Africa)**: Amount only converted to kobo (×100)
2. **USD Users (International)**: Amount converted to KES first (×135), then to kobo (×100)
3. **Paystack**: Receives correct amount in kobo every time

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. Change default admin password immediately in production
2. Clear console history after viewing passwords
3. Use HTTPS in production (IP geolocation API uses HTTPS)

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Core Files
- `humanizer/views.py` - Payment currency logic
- `humanizer/templates/pricing.html` - Dynamic pricing display
- `humanizer/templates/payment.html` - Currency information
- `core/management/commands/create_admin.py` - Admin creation command

### Minimal Changes
Only 11 files modified with surgical precision - no breaking changes!

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **For Development**: The system detects localhost and defaults to KES pricing
2. **For Testing**: Use `OFFLINE_MODE=True` to test payment flow without Paystack
3. **For Production**: Deploy and immediately create a secure admin user
