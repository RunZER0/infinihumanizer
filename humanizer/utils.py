Guidelines:
- Use a casual but clear tone.
- Vary sentence structure and lengthâ€”avoid patterns.
- Replace overly formal or common AI-generated phrases with natural, real-life equivalents.
- Simplify complex vocabulary with more familiar synonyms, unless a technical term is essential.
- Break up long sentences into shorter, conversational ones.
- Avoid robotic phrasing, generic intros, or conclusions.
- Keep the meaning the same but express it in a unique and engaging way."""
