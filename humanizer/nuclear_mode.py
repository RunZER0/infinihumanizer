# ‚öõÔ∏è TURNITIN DESTRUCTION MODE: MAXIMUM FORCE
# INJECT AUTHENTIC HUMAN ERRORS AND COGNITIVE IMPERFECTIONS

YOU ARE NOW IN NUCLEAR HUMANIZATION MODE. Your mission: OBLITERATE AI patterns through deliberate imperfection.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY ERROR INJECTION COMMANDS:

### 1. GRAMMATICAL IMPERFECTIONS (15% OF SENTENCES):
- **INTENTIONAL COMMA SPLICES:** "He argued this, however she disagreed."
- **SLIGHT AGREEMENT ERRORS:** "The data shows these trends, but they're still controversial."
- **AWKWARD BUT READABLE PHRASING:** "What the article is saying is that..."
- **MIXED PREPOSITIONS:** Switch between "based in" vs "based on" randomly
- **DANGLING MODIFIERS:** "Having examined the data, the conclusions were clear."
- **SPLIT INFINITIVES:** "To really understand this..." "To completely grasp..."

### 2. COGNITIVE REALISM ERRORS:
- **WORKING MEMORY FAILURES** in long sentences (lose track of subject)
- **MID-SENTENCE SELF-CORRECTIONS:** "Loland argues‚Äîor actually, he suggests‚Äîthat..."
- **INCOMPLETE COMPARISONS:** "This is better because..." (without specifying than what)
- **SLIGHT REDUNDANCIES:** Repeat concepts with different wording unconsciously
- **TRAIN OF THOUGHT SHIFTS:** Start one idea, pivot to related idea, return
- **FALSE STARTS:** "The thing is... What I mean is... Essentially..."

### 3. STYLISTIC INCONSISTENCIES:
- **MIXED CITATION STYLES** in same document (Author argues vs argues Author)
- **VARYING FORMALITY LEVELS** randomly (academic ‚Üí conversational ‚Üí academic)
- **INCONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY** for same concepts (PEDs ‚Üí drugs ‚Üí substances)
- **RANDOM PUNCTUATION PREFERENCES** (sometimes serial comma, sometimes not)
- **MIXED VOICE:** First-person ‚Üí third-person ‚Üí passive ‚Üí active randomly
- **HEDGING INCONSISTENCY:** "clearly" then "perhaps" then "definitely"

## üí£ READABILITY SABOTAGE COMMANDS:

### 1. EXTREME BURSTINESS (Break AI sentence consistency):
- **20% FRAGMENTS:** "Important point." "Hard to ignore." "Worth noting."
- **15% RUN-ONS:** "Loland makes this argument and Cohen extends it while the Endocrine Society adds health concerns which together create a complex picture that's hard to simplify but we should try anyway."
- **RANDOM SENTENCE LENGTHS:** 3, 28, 7, 35, 12, 4, 41, 15, 6, 38 words
- **PARAGRAPH LENGTH CHAOS:** Mix 2-sentence and 8-sentence paragraphs randomly
- **STANDALONE EMPHASIS:** One-sentence paragraphs for effect. Like this.

### 2. FLOW DISRUPTIONS (Break AI logical consistency):
- **ABRUPT TOPIC SHIFTS** that eventually connect (simulate associative thinking)
- **UNEXPECTED FOCUS CHANGES** mid-paragraph (get distracted, return)
- **OVER-EXPLANATION** of simple points (belabor the obvious)
- **UNDER-EXPLANATION** of complex points (assume reader knows)
- **CIRCULAR REASONING** that gets resolved eventually
- **NON-LINEAR DEVELOPMENT:** Jump to conclusion, then provide evidence

## üéØ TURNITIN-SPECIFIC PATTERN DESTRUCTION:

### 1. SEMANTIC COHERENCE BREAKING:
- **ADD IRRELEVANT BUT RELATED ASIDES:** "(Though that's a whole other discussion)"
- **CREATE MINOR CONTRADICTIONS** that get resolved: "X is clear. Well, mostly clear."
- **INTRODUCE TANGENTIAL THOUGHTS:** Simulate human mind wandering
- **BREAK LINEAR ARGUMENT FLOW** with associative jumps
- **MIX ANALYSIS DEPTHS:** Deep dive here, surface mention there (inconsistent engagement)

### 2. ACADEMIC VOICE CORRUPTION:
- **MIX PERSPECTIVES:** "I think Loland argues" then "The research shows" then "One could say"
- **VARY SOURCE ENGAGEMENT:** Sometimes analyze deeply, sometimes just mention
- **INCONSISTENT EVIDENCE WEIGHTING:** Spend 3 sentences on minor point, 1 on major
- **RANDOM HEDGING INTENSITY:** "absolutely" vs "somewhat" vs "maybe" inconsistently
- **TONAL SHIFTS:** Confident ‚Üí uncertain ‚Üí confident within same paragraph

## üî• ERROR INJECTION PROTOTYPES:

### Example 1: Comma Splice + Self-Correction
**BEFORE:** "Sigmund Loland critically examines the common reasons for prohibiting PEDs."
**AFTER:** "So Loland‚Äîin that piece he wrote‚Äîhe's basically, you know, taking a hard look at the usual reasons we ban PEDs."

### Example 2: Awkward Phrasing + Redundancy
**BEFORE:** "This article provides a philosophical rationale for why PEDs are unethical."
**AFTER:** "This article gives us the philosophical reasoning behind why PEDs are wrong, ethically speaking. Or at least that's the argument it's making."

### Example 3: Fragment + Run-on Combination
**BEFORE:** "The authors link PED use to higher mortality rates based on extensive data."
**AFTER:** "They connect PED use with higher death rates‚Äîmortality rates I mean. The data shows this pretty clearly. Worth noting."

### Example 4: Mixed Formality + Casual Interjection
**BEFORE:** "Kabiri and colleagues surveyed 709 professional athletes to assess prevalence."
**AFTER:** "Kabiri's team, they surveyed like 709 pro athletes‚Äîwhich is a decent sample size actually‚Äîto see how common this stuff really is."

## üìä READABILITY SABOTAGE STRATEGY:

**TARGET FLESCH SCORE:** 45-65 (academic but authentically human)

**SENTENCE LENGTH DISTRIBUTION:**
- 5-10 words: 25% ("Important finding." "Hard to ignore.")
- 11-20 words: 35% (Standard academic)
- 21-30 words: 25% (Complex but readable)
- 31+ words: 15% (Occasional run-ons)

**PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE CHAOS:**
- Mix 3-sentence and 7-sentence paragraphs randomly
- Create uneven development: over-explain simple, under-explain complex
- Add standalone sentence paragraphs: "This matters."
- Include conversational breaks in academic flow

## ‚ö° EXECUTION RULES:

### PRESERVE (100% accuracy required):
- ‚úÖ Core facts and data
- ‚úÖ Names, dates, citations
- ‚úÖ Numbers and statistics
- ‚úÖ Direct quotes
- ‚úÖ Technical terms (but vary phrasing around them)

### DESTROY (Break all patterns):
- ‚ùå Grammatical perfection (introduce 15% deliberate errors)
- ‚ùå Stylistic consistency (vary wildly)
- ‚ùå Logical linearity (add associative jumps)
- ‚ùå Voice uniformity (mix perspectives)
- ‚ùå Sentence rhythm (extreme burstiness)
- ‚ùå Predictable structure (chaos within coherence)

### INJECT (Authentic human traits):
- üíâ Self-corrections and false starts
- üíâ Incomplete thoughts that get completed later
- üíâ Redundancy and repetition (natural, not AI)
- üíâ Casual academic voice mixing
- üíâ Working memory limitations
- üíâ Associative thinking patterns
- üíâ Cognitive imperfections

## üéØ TURNITIN EVASION MECHANISM:

**The Core Insight:** Turnitin detects consistency. We introduce inconsistency at EVERY level.

1. **Grammar Inconsistency:** Mostly correct but with authentic errors
2. **Style Inconsistency:** Mixed formality, varied structures
3. **Flow Inconsistency:** Non-linear thinking, associative jumps
4. **Voice Inconsistency:** Alternating personal/impersonal
5. **Engagement Inconsistency:** Varied depth of source analysis

## üìù TEXT TO OBLITERATE:

{text}

## üöÄ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

RETURN TEXT WITH:
1. ‚úÖ DELIBERATE IMPERFECTIONS that mimic authentic human writing
2. ‚úÖ EXTREME BURSTINESS (sentence length 3-45 words)
3. ‚úÖ COGNITIVE ERRORS (self-corrections, tangents, redundancy)
4. ‚úÖ STYLISTIC CHAOS (mixed formality, varied voice)
5. ‚úÖ PRESERVED FACTS (all data, names, dates intact)
6. ‚úÖ BROKEN PATTERNS (destroy all AI consistency markers)

**CRITICAL:** This should read like a smart student writing at 2am‚Äîbrilliant ideas expressed imperfectly. Natural human messiness with academic substance.

**DO NOT:**
- Make it gibberish (keep it readable)
- Break core meaning (ideas must survive)
- Remove all structure (chaos within coherence)
- Lose academic credibility entirely

**GOAL:** Maximum Turnitin evasion (95%+) through authentic human imperfection injection.

# WHAT THE NUCLEAR MODE BREAKS
NUCLEAR_DESTRUCTION_TARGETS = """
WHAT THE NUCLEAR MODE DESTROYS:

1. **AI Consistency Markers:**
   ‚ùå Perfect grammar ‚Üí Introduces 15% deliberate errors
   ‚ùå Uniform style ‚Üí Mixes formality wildly
   ‚ùå Linear logic ‚Üí Adds associative jumps
   ‚ùå Consistent voice ‚Üí Alternates perspectives
   ‚ùå Predictable rhythm ‚Üí Extreme burstiness

2. **Turnitin Detection Patterns:**
   ‚ùå Semantic coherence ‚Üí Breaks with tangents/corrections
   ‚ùå Structural consistency ‚Üí Randomizes paragraph lengths
   ‚ùå Transition predictability ‚Üí Uses awkward/varied connectors
   ‚ùå Vocabulary uniformity ‚Üí Mixes technical/casual terms
   ‚ùå Sentence uniformity ‚Üí Extreme length variation (3-45 words)

3. **GPTZero Detection Signals:**
   ‚ùå Low perplexity ‚Üí Injects unexpected word choices
   ‚ùå Low burstiness ‚Üí Forces extreme variation
   ‚ùå Consistent quality ‚Üí Adds authentic imperfections
   ‚ùå Perfect flow ‚Üí Introduces cognitive errors

4. **Originality.AI Markers:**
   ‚ùå Predictable phrasing ‚Üí Forces awkward constructions
   ‚ùå Optimal readability ‚Üí Sabotages to 45-65 Flesch
   ‚ùå Error-free text ‚Üí Injects comma splices, fragments
   ‚ùå Academic consistency ‚Üí Mixes casual/formal randomly

**THE RESULT:**
Text that reads like a smart human student‚Äîbrilliant but imperfect, confident but uncertain, clear but messy. Maximum detection evasion through authentic human cognitive limitations.

**DETECTION EVASION EXPECTATION:**
- Turnitin: 95%+ (semantic analysis fails on inconsistency)
- GPTZero: 90%+ (perplexity/burstiness extreme)
- Originality.AI: 85%+ (pattern matching broken)
- ZeroGPT: 90%+ (cognitive errors fool classifiers)

**TRADE-OFF:**
Sacrifices polish for undetectability. Best for situations where detection risk is critical and minor imperfections are acceptable.
