# Humanizer Logic Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the humanizer logic in `humanizer/utils.py` to produce more authentic, human-like text with high perplexity while maintaining formal academic tone.

## Problem Addressed
The original humanizer was not producing truly human-like text. It needed:
1. Higher perplexity (sophisticated, varied vocabulary)
2. Better readability with natural flow
3. Complete structural alteration (not sentence-by-sentence paraphrasing)
4. Maintained formal academic tone

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
**Changed:** From generic "academic rephraser" to "expert at transforming AI-generated text"

**Key additions:**
- Explicit emphasis on high perplexity
- Specific sentence length ranges (3-5 to 25-40 words)
- Requirement for COMPLETE restructuring
- Emphasis on natural readability

### 2. Improved Style Demo
**Changed:** Provided better before/after example

**Improvements:**
- More robotic source text (with AI phrases like "furthermore", "moreover")
- Demonstrates dramatic sentence variation (2 words to 30+ words)
- Shows structural reorganization
- Illustrates sophisticated vocabulary use

### 3. Clarified User Prompt
**Changed:** From vague "rephrase" to explicit numbered requirements

**Features:**
- "Transform" instead of "rephrase"
- Numbered list of requirements
- Key terms in CAPS (COMPLETELY, HIGH PERPLEXITY)
- More specific and actionable

### 4. Optimized Sampling Parameters

| Parameter | Before | After | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Temperature | 0.6 | 0.9 | More creative, varied output |
| Top P | 0.95 | 0.92 | Focus on quality diverse tokens |
| Frequency Penalty | 0.2 | 0.4 | Encourage vocabulary diversity |
| Presence Penalty | 0.0 | 0.3 | Encourage topic diversity |

## Testing
Added 12 comprehensive unit tests in `humanizer/tests.py`:
- Validates prompt improvements
- Tests parameter changes
- Ensures formal tone maintained
- All tests pass successfully

## Expected Behavior

### Before:
- Minor word substitutions
- Light restructuring
- Uniform sentence patterns
- Predictable vocabulary

### After:
- Complete content reorganization
- Sophisticated, varied vocabulary
- Dramatic sentence length variation
- Natural flow while maintaining formal tone
- Human-feeling language

## Usage
No API changes - the `humanize_text()` function signature remains the same. The improvements are internal to how it generates output.

```python
from humanizer.utils import humanize_text

# Use exactly as before
result = humanize_text("Your AI-generated text here")
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ Higher perplexity through sophisticated vocabulary
2. ✅ Complete structural reorganization
3. ✅ Natural sentence variation (very short to very long)
4. ✅ Maintains formal academic tone
5. ✅ More human-feeling output
6. ✅ Better readability

## Files Changed
- `humanizer/utils.py` - Core logic improvements
- `humanizer/tests.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Backward Compatibility
All changes are backward compatible. The function signature and return type remain unchanged.
