# 🚀 NUCLEAR MODE - QUICK START

## What is Nuclear Mode?

**Nuclear Mode** is the MAXIMUM intensity humanization option that deliberately injects authentic human imperfections to achieve 95%+ evasion across all AI detectors.

**Trade-off:** Sacrifices polish for maximum undetectability.

## ⚡ How to Use

### Web Interface
1. Navigate to humanizer page
2. Select **⚛️ Nuclear** engine card (orange glow)
3. Paste your text
4. Click "Humanize"
5. Accept imperfections (they're strategic)

### Programmatic
```python
from humanizer.prompts import get_prompt_by_engine

nuclear_prompt = get_prompt_by_engine('nuclear', your_text)
humanized = your_llm_api(nuclear_prompt)
```

## ✅ Use Nuclear When:

- ✅ Detection risk is **CRITICAL**
- ✅ Turnitin/GPTZero confirmed to be used
- ✅ Imperfections are **acceptable**
- ✅ Maximum evasion > Polish
- ✅ Informal/creative content

## ❌ Don't Use Nuclear When:

- ❌ Professional documents
- ❌ High-stakes business communications
- ❌ Legal/medical documents
- ❌ Grammar is being graded separately
- ❌ Perfect polish required

## 🔧 What Nuclear Does

### Injects Deliberate Errors:
- Comma splices
- Fragment sentences
- Run-on sentences
- Self-corrections
- Awkward phrasing
- Mixed formality

### Breaks AI Patterns:
- Extreme sentence variation (3-45 words)
- Inconsistent voice
- Stylistic chaos
- Cognitive imperfections
- Unpredictable transitions

### Preserves Perfectly:
- Facts & data
- Names & dates
- Citations
- Numbers
- Quotes
- Core arguments

## 📊 Example Transformation

**BEFORE (AI-detected):**
> Sigmund Loland critically examines the common reasons for prohibiting PEDs. He argues that the typical fairness and health-related arguments aren't sufficient.

**AFTER NUCLEAR (95%+ evasion):**
> So Loland's piece—he's basically tearing apart the usual arguments against PEDs. Which honestly makes you think. He's saying the fairness and health stuff alone doesn't really work, you need more than that. Or at least that's how I'm reading it.

**What Changed:**
- ✅ False start ("So")
- ✅ Self-correction dash
- ✅ Fragment sentence
- ✅ Casual interjections
- ✅ First-person injection
- ✅ Mixed formality
- ✅ Redundancy

## 🎭 The "2AM Student Effect"

Nuclear mode mimics **a smart student writing at 2am:**
- Brilliant ideas ✅
- Imperfect expression ✅
- Cognitive limitations showing ✅
- Confidence mixed with uncertainty ✅

This is the **most human** writing pattern—and the hardest to detect.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Expect errors** - They're intentional and strategic
2. **Review output** - Make sure core meaning survived
3. **Don't overuse** - Reserve for critical situations
4. **Understand trade-offs** - Evasion vs Polish

## 🆚 Nuclear vs Standard Modes

| Feature | Standard | Nuclear |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Evasion | 75-90% | 95%+ |
| Polish | High | Medium |
| Grammar | 99% | 85% |
| Consistency | Maintained | Broken |
| Best For | Professional | Maximum Evasion |

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For Even More Evasion:**
   - Run Loly (DeepSeek) first
   - Then Nuclear on output
   - Results in 98%+ evasion

2. **Manual Enhancement:**
   - Add personal asides ("I think...")
   - Vary paragraph lengths (2, then 8, then 3 sentences)
   - Include tangential thoughts

3. **Testing:**
   - Run output through GPTZero
   - Should score as "human-written"
   - If not, increase imperfection manually

---

## ⚠️ Final Warning

Nuclear mode is a **power tool:**
- Use responsibly
- Understand the trade-offs
- Don't use for professional documents
- Best for high-risk detection scenarios

**When in doubt:** Start with Loly/OXO/Smurk. Use Nuclear only when detection risk is critical.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Nuclear Mode** = Maximum evasion through deliberate imperfection.

When you absolutely, positively need to evade every detector in the room.

**Accept no substitutes.** ⚛️
