# Model Upgrades Summary - Authentic Human Writing Patterns

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Server Running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## 🎯 Upgrade Objective

Enhanced all three AI models (Loly, OXO, Smurk) to produce MORE AUTHENTIC human academic writing with:
- **Unnecessary verbosity** (whereby, insofar as, with regard to)
- **Contractions** mixed with formal prose (it's, doesn't, can't)
- **Long run-on sentences** (10-15% for Loly, 8-10% for OXO, 6-8% for Smurk)
- **Missing punctuation** (commas, periods occasionally)
- **More grammatical errors** but still readable
- **Sentence reorganization** and awkward phrasings
- **High perplexity vocabulary**

## 📊 Model Configurations

### 1. **Loly (DeepSeek)** - Beat Detectors 🔥

**Purpose**: Optimized to bypass AI detection systems

**Temperature Settings**:
- Base: `0.84` (increased from 0.82)
- Variation: `0.12` (increased from 0.10)
- Max tokens: 4000

**Key Features**:
- **Grammatical errors**: 8-12%
- **Unnecessary verbosity**: FREQUENT
  - "whereby the evidence suggests"
  - "insofar as the data reveals"
  - "in order to adequately and sufficiently demonstrate"
- **Contractions**: 5-8% (it's, that's, doesn't)
- **Long run-ons**: 10-15%
- **Missing punctuation**: 8-12%
- **High perplexity words**: dovetail, sui generis, vis-à-vis, mutatis mutandis
- **Readability floor**: 70-75%

**Example Output Style**:
> "To begin with, the research don't indicate clear outcomes whereby it's evident that PEDs have significant health consequences and the data support this claim insofar as one observes the patterns in cardiovascular psychiatric and social consequences which matter greatly for understanding the phenomenon in question."

### 2. **OXO (Claude)** - Balanced ⭕ **[DEFAULT]**

**Purpose**: Perfect balance of quality and authenticity

**Temperature Settings**:
- Base: `0.82` (increased from 0.81)

- **Moderate run-ons**: 8-10%
- **Missing punctuation**: 5-8%
- **Balanced perplexity words**: dovetail, elucidate, notwithstanding
- **Readability floor**: 75-78%

**Example Output Style**:
> "However it should be noted that the research doesn't indicate clear outcomes whereby the evidence suggests that PEDs have significant health consequences and the data support this claim insofar as one observes the patterns. Consequently, the implications are substantial."

### 3. **Smurk (OpenAI)** - Best Quality ⚡

**Purpose**: Highest quality output with natural errors

**Temperature Settings**:
- Base: `0.80` (increased from 0.78)
- Variation: `0.09` (increased from 0.08)
- Top_p: `0.94` (increased from 0.93)
- Frequency penalty: `0.27` (increased from 0.25)
- Presence penalty: `0.12` (increased from 0.10)
- Max tokens: 2000

**Key Features**:
- **Grammatical errors**: 7-9%
- **Moderate verbosity**: MODERATE
  - "whereby the evidence suggests"
  - "insofar as the data reveals"
  - "in order to adequately demonstrate"
- **Contractions**: 3-5%
- **Occasional run-ons**: 6-8%
- **Missing punctuation**: 5-7%
- **Moderate perplexity words**: dovetail, elucidate, sui generis
- **Readability floor**: 78-80% (HIGHEST)

**Example Output Style**:
> "To begin with, the research demonstrate that PEDs have significant health consequences whereby the evidence suggest this is clear. However it should be noted that the implications don't fully capture the complexity of the matter insofar as additional research is needed."

## 📝 New Writing Patterns (All Models)

### 1. **Unnecessary Verbose Formal Constructions**
- "it is within the broader context of the literature that one observes"
- "in order to adequately and sufficiently demonstrate the point at hand"
- "the phenomenon in question exhibits characteristics which are indicative of"
- "whereby the evidence suggests that" (USE FREQUENTLY)
- "insofar as the data reveals" (USE FREQUENTLY)
- "with regard to the matter of"
- "notwithstanding the limitations of"

### 2. **Contractions Mixed with Formal Writing**
- Loly: 5-8% usage
- OXO: 4-6% usage
- Smurk: 3-5% usage
- Examples: "it's evident that", "the research doesn't indicate", "what's central"

### 3. **Long Run-On Sentences**
- Loly: 10-15% (most aggressive)
- OXO: 8-10% (balanced)
- Smurk: 6-8% (moderate)
- Combine 2-4 ideas with commas and conjunctions
- Keep readable but lengthy

### 4. **Missing Punctuation**
- Loly: 8-12%
- OXO: 5-8%
- Smurk: 5-7%
- Missing commas after transitions: "However it remains unclear"
- Missing commas in lists: "cardiovascular psychiatric and social"
- Occasional missing periods

### 5. **Increased Grammatical Errors**
- Loly: 8-12% (highest)
- OXO: 7-10% (balanced)
- Smurk: 7-9% (moderate)
- Subject-verb disagreement
- Missing articles
- Wrong prepositions

### 6. **High Perplexity Vocabulary**
All models use archaic/formal academic words:
- dovetail, elucidate, instantiate, adumbrate, evince
- sui generis, vis-à-vis, qua, inter alia
- whereby, insofar as, inasmuch as, notwithstanding
- mutatis mutandis, militate against
