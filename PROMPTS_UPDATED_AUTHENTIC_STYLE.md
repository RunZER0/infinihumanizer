# ‚úÖ ENGINE PROMPTS UPDATED - BASED ON AUTHENTIC HUMAN WRITING SAMPLE

## Summary

Both DeepSeek and OpenAI prompts have been **completely rewritten** based on your authentic human academic writing sample. The prompts now target EXACTLY the style you showed.

---

## üéØ YOUR EXAMPLE - KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

From your conversation, I analyzed this authentic human writing:

```
To begin, Loland push back against the routine appeals to fairness and health. 
These reasons, he says, do not stand alone but rather, they become clear only 
inside a deeper account of what sport is for. Natural versus artificial is not 
always a rigid wall; it is, admittedly, a porous boundary. He argues that training 
knowledge, formal rules, bodies, and culture are integrated thereby forming an 
ideal of "natural performance" that is neither na√Øve nor rustic.
```

### Patterns Found:

1. ‚úÖ **Subject-verb disagreement**: "Loland push back" (should be "pushes")
2. ‚úÖ **Comma splices**: Multiple independent clauses joined with commas
3. ‚úÖ **Verbose transitions**: "To begin,", "Consequently,", "Nonetheless,"
4. ‚úÖ **Awkward phrasing**: "inside a deeper account", "thereby forming"
5. ‚úÖ **NO semicolons or em-dashes** for elaboration
6. ‚úÖ **Archaic formal words**: "dovetail with", "sui generis", "telos", "ethos"
7. ‚úÖ **Natural redundancy**: "rarely does human text lack unnecessary verbose"

## üìù NEW PROMPTS - WHAT CHANGED

### Temperature Settings Updated:

**DeepSeek (Loly):**
- **BEFORE:** `base_temperature: 0.7`, `variation: 0.15`
- **AFTER:** `base_temperature: 0.85`, `variation: 0.10`
- **Why:** Higher temp (0.85) creates more natural human variation

**OpenAI (Smurk):**
- **BEFORE:** `base_temperature: 0.6`, `variation: 0.12`
- **AFTER:** `base_temperature: 0.82`, `variation: 0.08`
- **Why:** Higher temp (0.82) matches human unpredictability
- **Also adjusted:** `top_p: 0.95`, `frequency_penalty: 0.3`

---

## üî• NEW SYSTEM PROMPT STRUCTURE

Both engines now follow this EXACT pattern structure:

### 1. Subject-Verb Agreement Errors (8-12%)

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "Loland push back against..."
- "the evidence don't follow..."
- "it supply the empirical anchor..."
- "This analysis dovetail with..."

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Use singular subjects with plural verbs or vice versa NATURALLY and SUBTLY.
```

---

### 2. Comma Splices (15-20% - FREQUENT)

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "this point matter, they associate..."
- "audiences do perceive, hence public anger..."

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Join independent clauses with ONLY commas, no conjunctions.
Make it feel natural, like spoken academic language written down.
```

---

### 3. Unusual But Formal Phrasing

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "inside a deeper account" (not "within")
- "thereby forming" (archaic connector)
- "as pronounced in studies" (awkward placement)
- "which is an awkward echo but illustrative"

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Use slightly OFF phrasings that educated people might write quickly.
```

---

### 4. ABSOLUTELY NO SEMICOLONS OR HYPHENS

**YOUR INSTRUCTION:**
> "forget about using hyphens, we barely use those"

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
ABSOLUTELY NO SEMICOLONS OR HYPHENS FOR ELABORATION:
- NEVER use semicolons (;)
- NEVER use em-dashes (‚Äî) or hyphens for clarification
- Use commas and periods ONLY
- Connect ideas with: "and therefore,", "hence,", "consequently,"
```

---

### 5. Verbose Transitional Phrases (OVERUSE)

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "To begin,"
- "Consequently,"
- "Nonetheless,"
- "Moreover,"
- "Accordingly,"
- "Indeed,"

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
VERBOSE TRANSITIONAL PHRASES (OVERUSE THESE):
Start sentences with these FREQUENTLY.
```

---

### 6. Sentence Fragments (5-8%)

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "Useful, indeed."
- "For my project."

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Use short fragments after longer sentences for emphasis.
```

---

### 7. Archaic/Formal Academic Words

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "dovetail with" (not "align with")
- "sui generis" (unique)
- "telos" (purpose/goal)
- "ethos" (character/spirit)

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Use Latin terms and old-fashioned academic vocabulary naturally mixed in.
```

---

### 8. Natural Redundancy and Verbose Constructions

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "rarely does human text lack unnecessary verbose"
- "inside a deeper account of what sport is for"
- "thereby forming an ideal of natural performance"

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Don't be concise. Humans writing academically ADD words.
```

---

### 9. Awkward Word Order

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "as audiences do perceive" (not "as audiences perceive")
- "this point matter" (verb at end)

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Place verbs and modifiers in slightly unexpected positions.
```

---

### 10. Mix Singular/Plural Inconsistently

**EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WRITING:**
- "morbidities such cardiovascular, psychiatric..." (such, not such as)
- "almost no finance" (not finances)
- "the evidence don't" (plural verb with singular noun)

**PROMPT NOW SAYS:**
```
Use inconsistent singular/plural constructions naturally.
```

## üéØ EXACT PROMPT EXCERPTS

### DeepSeek Prompt (First Section):

```python
"""YOU ARE REWRITING TEXT TO MATCH AUTHENTIC HUMAN ACADEMIC WRITING WITH NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS.

## CRITICAL WRITING PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:

1. **SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT ERRORS (MANDATORY - 8-12% of sentences):**
   - "Loland push back against..."
   - "the evidence don't follow..."
   - "it supply the empirical anchor..."
   - "This analysis dovetail with..."
   Use singular subjects with plural verbs or vice versa NATURALLY and SUBTLY.

2. **COMMA SPLICES (FREQUENT - 15-20% of sentences):**
   - "this point matter, they associate..."
   - "audiences do perceive, hence public anger..."
   - Join independent clauses with ONLY commas, no conjunctions needed.
   - Make it feel natural, like spoken academic language written down.

4. **ABSOLUTELY NO SEMICOLONS OR HYPHENS FOR ELABORATION:**
   - NEVER use semicolons (;)
   - NEVER use em-dashes (‚Äî) or hyphens for clarification
   - Use commas and periods ONLY
```

### OpenAI Prompt (Matching):

```python
"""YOU ARE REWRITING TEXT TO MATCH AUTHENTIC HUMAN ACADEMIC WRITING WITH NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS.

## CRITICAL WRITING PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:

1. **SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT ERRORS (MANDATORY - 8-12% of sentences):**
   - "Loland push back against..."
   - "the evidence don't follow..."
   - "it supply the empirical anchor..."
```

**BOTH ENGINES NOW IDENTICAL IN APPROACH** - Just different temperature settings for variety.

---

## üîß TEMPERATURE SETTINGS EXPLAINED

### DeepSeek: 0.85 (High)
```python
"base_temperature": 0.85,  # Higher = more natural variation
"temperature_variation": 0.10,  # Slight variation per chunk
```

**What this means:**
- 0.85 is quite high (0.0 = robotic, 1.0 = maximum creativity)
- Will produce MORE varied, natural-feeling output
- Closer to how humans write with spontaneity
- Less predictable word choices

### OpenAI: 0.82 (High)
```python
"base_temperature": 0.82,  # Higher for natural human variation
"temperature_variation": 0.08,  # Slight variation per chunk
"top_p": 0.95,  # Higher for more diverse word choices
"frequency_penalty": 0.3,  # Reduce repetition
```

**What this means:**
- 0.82 temperature = high creativity
- 0.95 top_p = considers 95% of probability mass (very diverse)
- 0.3 frequency penalty = strongly discourages repetition
- Perfect for mimicking human academic writing's natural variety

---

## üìù USER PROMPT TEMPLATE UPDATED

**BEFORE:**
```python
"Humanize this text while preserving its core message..."
```

**AFTER:**
```python
"Rewrite this text to match natural human academic writing with the 
imperfections described above. Preserve all facts and citations exactly:"
```

**Why:** More direct reference to the specific patterns in the system prompt.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW

When you humanize text with either engine:

1. ‚úÖ **Subject-verb errors**: "The research suggest..." instead of "suggests"
2. ‚úÖ **Comma splices**: "this matter, it show..." instead of proper punctuation
3. ‚úÖ **NO semicolons**: Will use commas and periods ONLY
4. ‚úÖ **NO em-dashes**: Will use commas for clarification
5. ‚úÖ **Verbose transitions**: "To begin,", "Consequently,", "Nonetheless," frequently
6. ‚úÖ **Archaic words**: "dovetail", "sui generis", "telos", "ethos" naturally mixed
7. ‚úÖ **Awkward phrasing**: "inside a deeper account", "thereby forming"
8. ‚úÖ **Fragments**: "Useful, indeed." after longer sentences
9. ‚úÖ **Natural redundancy**: More words than necessary (like human academic writing)
10. ‚úÖ **Awkward word order**: "as audiences do perceive" placement

## üß™ TESTING EXAMPLE

**INPUT (AI-generated):**
```
The research demonstrates that performance-enhancing drugs have significant 
health consequences; however, these risks are often overlooked.
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT (Your style):**
```
To begin, the research demonstrate that PEDs have significant health consequences, 
these risks are however often overlooked. The evidence don't suggest otherwise, 
it supply substantial documentation thereby forming a robust foundation. Useful, 
indeed.
```

**Pattern matches:**
- ‚úÖ "research demonstrate" (subject-verb error)
- ‚úÖ Comma splice: "consequences, these risks..."
- ‚úÖ "The evidence don't" (plural verb, singular subject)
- ‚úÖ "thereby forming" (archaic connector)
- ‚úÖ "Useful, indeed." (fragment)
- ‚úÖ NO semicolons (removed the original one)
- ‚úÖ Verbose: "To begin," opening
